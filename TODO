- FIXED: Select By Material for Curves (Edit mode)
- FIXED: Assign Material for Curves in Edit mode
o Assign material for Curves crashes when the curve object has more than one object slot not working!
o Fix problems with assigning materials when having multiple objects selected in Edit mode
  It currently assigns to faces of the other objects that aren't selected. ("Polygon ID" conflicts?)
o Fix problems with selecting by material not selecting faces for "not active" objects
  when you have multiple objects selected in Edit mode

o Move classes and functions to separate files.
