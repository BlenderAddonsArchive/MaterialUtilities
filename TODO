- FIXED: Select By Material for Curves (Edit mode)
- FIXED: Assign Material for Curves in Edit mode

- This seems to work in the latest buid of Blender 2.80 (2019-07-11, Pre RC)!!
    CRASH: Assign material for Curves crashes when the curve object has more than one object slot not working!

o Add Add-on properties
o Use material lists for material selection in operator panels

o Fix problems with assigning materials when having multiple objects selected in Edit mode
  It currently assigns to faces of the other objects that aren't selected. ("Polygon ID" conflicts?)
o Fix problems with selecting by material not selecting faces for "not active" objects
  when you have multiple objects selected in Edit mode

o (?) Add "Rename Textures" - This will require some rework to fit in 2.8

o Add "Copy material to others" to Edit mode,
  where the material of the active face is copied to the other selected faces
