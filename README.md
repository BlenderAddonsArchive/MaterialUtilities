# Material utilities v0.1
An add-on for Blender 2.8x that lets the user assign materials directly in the 3D viewport (via a keyboard shortcut and a pop up menu), as well as select by material and more!

**This ALPHA, and still under development, you're welcome to use it, but be aware that it might not work smoothly!**

## Background

This is based on the Add-on Material Utils by Michael Williamson (michaelw), originally written for Blender 2.4, and then ported by him to Blender 2.6.

## Installation

1. Download the Add-on as a ZIP-file.
2. In Blender 2.8 go to *Edit* > *Preferences*, select *Add-ons* in the left panel, and then *Install* in the upper right.
3. Browse to where you saved the ZIP-file, select it and click on *Install Add-on from File*.
4. Click the checkbox to the left to enable the Add-on.
5. (Click the menu icon in the lower left and select *Save Current State*, unless you have Auto-save Preferences on)

## Usage

The default shortcut for Material Utilities (henceforth MU) is `Shift + Q`


## Known issues

- The selection by material only works for the active object in Edit mode.
  If you have multiple objects selected and "open" in Edit mode, it won't select any of the faces,
  with the selected material, of the other objects.
- The assignment of material when you have multiple objects selected in Edit mode doesn't work correctly
  and give Unexpected results.
