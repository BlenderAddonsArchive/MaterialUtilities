# Material utilities v0.1

## Background

This is based on the Add-on Material Utils by Michael Williamson (michaelw), originally written for Blender 2.4, and then ported by him to Blender 2.6.
Since it haven't seen any development since 2010, and it's an add-on that I've found usefull (and missed instantly in Blender 2.8), I decided to port it to 2.8 myself, while also adding some more functinality.

## Installation

1. Download the Add-on as a ZIP-file.
2. In Blender 2.8 go to *Edit* > *Preferences*, select *Add-ons* in the left panel, and then *Install* in the upper right.
3. Browse to where you saved the ZIP-file, select it and click on *Install Add-on from File*.
4. Click the checkbox to the left to enable the Add-on.
5. (Click the menu icon in the lower left and select *Save Current State*, unless you have Auto-save Preferences on)

## Usage

The default shortcut for Material Utilities (henceforth MU) is `Shift + Q`[^1]



## Support

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/fraction/readme-boilerplate/issues/new) for support.

[^1]: The original Add-on used `Q` as the default shortcut, but since that now is used for "Quick Favorites" `Shift + Q` was selected instead.
